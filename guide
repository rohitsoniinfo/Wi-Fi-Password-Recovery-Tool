you need wifi card with monitor mode and packet injection 
and kali linux machine or any other linux machine.

aircrack-ng 


1. run the preAutomate.sh and identify the target and note the channel number(under ch) and bssid(under bssid)
here we are getting the handshake.
./preAutomate.sh
2. use CTRL+C to quit.
3. run the postAutomate.sh and deauthenticate the device
./postAutomate.sh
4. this is the final step and now you need to run attack.sh and here you get your password.
./attack.sh
